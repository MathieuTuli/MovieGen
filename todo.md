- [ ] fps considerations?
    - tbh I forget what this means
    - wait, from paper:
    - *"Controlling the FPS. We use FPS conditioning to control the length of the generated videos by pre-appending the sampling FPS value of each training video to the input text prompt (e.g., “FPS-16”). During pre-training, we sample video clips at their original FPS with minimum of 16 FPS. In finetuning, we sample clips at two fixed FPS values of 16 and 24."*
- TAE pipeline
    - [x] validate training working
    - [ ] DDP loader
    - [ ] batch multi-frame masking for loss
    - [ ] clean up training script logging and args and training resume (or continuation)
    - [ ] build inference pipeline
    - [x] validate outlier penalty loss which handles spots
    - [ ] efficient inference using temporal tiling
- MovieGen pipeline
    - [ ] build training pipeline
    - [ ] DDP loader
    - [ ] build inference pipeline
- Model sharding
    - [ ] implement techniques from paper
